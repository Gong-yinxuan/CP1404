1.What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?
80%

2.What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?
On Sundays, watch videos at home.

3.What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I try to understand the logic behind the code rather than simply copying and pasting. And try to solve the same problem in multiple ways.

4.What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I sometimes rely too much on examples from class notes without trying to solve enough problems on my own.

5.What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?
I try to plan more carefully before writing code and check my logic step by step, rather than rushing into a hurry and making a lot of small mistakes.

6.What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
I can find out why the code is not working properly and use logical thinking to fix it.
